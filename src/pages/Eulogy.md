# Eulogy
Welcome, everyone. We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of Walter L. Johnson, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend. Walter lived a full and rich life, marked by service, intellectual curiosity, and a deep love for his family. From his early days as an Eagle Scout in Hawaii to his career in social services and his later pursuits in computing, Walter consistently demonstrated a commitment to helping others and a passion for learning.


## Walter's Childhood and Early Life
Walter's childhood was shaped by his father's career as an Air Force officer, leading to a life of travel and diverse experiences. He lived in several locations, including Labrador, where he recounted stories of deep snow and swarming mosquitoes, and Grand Junction and Colorado Springs, where later visits revealed how different childhood memories could be from reality with how small the house looked as an adult. One particularly poignant memory was of him as a young boy, standing on the couch, eagerly watching for his father's return home. This early experience instilled in him a deep appreciation for family and connection. In Hawaii, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, an accomplishment he was immensely proud of. Among his scouting memories was serving at President Kennedy's court, albeit with wooden rifles. His scout dinner, hosted by Air Force Generals , was his first experience with Baked Alaska, a dessert he fondly remembered throughout his life.

## Walter's Career and Professional Life
Walter pursued higher education, earning a degree in political science and psychology. His first job after college was as a social worker in Lamar, Colorado. He was deeply affected by a case involving a destitute man who prioritized the care of his horses over his own health. Despite Walter's efforts to get him medical assistance, the man tragically passed away, an experience that profoundly impacted Walter. He later transitioned to a role as a statistician for the Colorado social services department in Denver. It was here that he discovered his passion for computers, becoming a self-taught expert in the early days of the technology. His dedication to his work often resulted in 18-hour days, ultimately contributing to his development of carpal tunnel syndrome. They had to replace him with multiple people when he could no longer work.

## Walter's Personal Life and Relationships
Walter's personal life was rich with love and connection. He spent his life in the Catholic church and always tried to live by those tenants in trying to help others. He met his wife in January 1977, shortly after her return from a sabbatical in Italy. Initially, she thought he was an accountant, but a shared membership in a Catholic Alumni club led to dancing lessons and a whirlwind courtship.   For six months, he showered her with roses and cards, demonstrating his deep affection. They were married on August 6, 1977, embarking on a 47-year marriage filled with adventure and shared passions. They hiked the Grand Canyon with their young sons. It was in the winter to make the temperature better at the bottom but didn’t take into account how quickly the sun goes down inside the Caynon in the winter and ended up spending the night on the trail (which you generally should not do) When getting down to the bottom in the morning we could see crossing the bridge across the Colorado River and Dominic start singing “oh say can you see” he was so excited. And it gave a chance for the kids to also play board games, and mingle with people from all over the world at the Phantom Ranch.He also enjoyed biking, rock climbing, and camping. Walter taught his wife how to do hiking steps, a testament to his willingness to share his knowledge and passions. 
His love for Star Trek was a shared interest with his family, leading to many enjoyable evenings watching the show and reading the accompanying books. He was also a dedicated researcher, delving into medical research for his long-time doctor at Kaiser. His interest in World War II stemmed from his father's experience as a Pearl Harbor survivor and an American flag the family got that was flying during the attack at Pearl Harbor. 
Walter wasn’t a particularly adventurous eater, preferring simple meals like beef stew and hamburgers. However, he had a sweet tooth and always kept a stash of high-quality candy. Brownies were a particular favorite. 
Walter enjoyed debating, particularly on political topics, sometimes with less tact than others, but always with a strong belief in justice. He was a dedicated counselor to his nephew, Chris Baird, and was known for his honesty. He also maintained a long-lasting friendship with his best man, Allen Hodgson, with whom he shared a love of debate.

## Walter's Legacy and Enduring Impact
Walter's legacy is one of service, dedication, and love. He dedicated his career to helping others, both as a social worker and through his work with computers. His passion for learning and his willingness to share his knowledge enriched the lives of those around him. He instilled a love of Star Trek and flashlights in his children and grandchildren, creating lasting family traditions. His recent trip to Italy, Croatia, and Montenegro allowed him to connect with his ancestral heritage, a deeply meaningful experience. His commitment to his family, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering belief in justice will continue to inspire those who knew him.


Walter L. Johnson lived a life of purpose and meaning. He touched the lives of many through his work, his passions, and his unwavering love for his family. He will be deeply missed but fondly remembered. As we say goodbye, we can take comfort in knowing that his memory and the values he embodied will continue to live on in the hearts of those who loved him. A final thought: may we all strive to live with the same dedication, curiosity, and love that Walter demonstrated throughout his life.
